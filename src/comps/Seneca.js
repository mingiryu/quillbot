            <p data-position="1">
                When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for
                one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of
                the earth a position different from that which they have
                hitherto occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of
                nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
                mankindrequires that they should declare the causes that impel
                them to such a course.
            </p>

            <p data-position="2">
                We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women
                are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
                certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,
                and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights
                governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the
                consent of the governed. Whenever any form of government becomes
                destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer
                from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist upon the
                institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such
                principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
                shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
                Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established
                should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
                accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more
                disposed to suffer. while evils are sufferable, than to right
                themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
                But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
                invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them
                under absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such
                government, and to provide new guards for their future security.
                Such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this
                government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them
                to demand the equal station to which they are entitled. The
                history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and
                usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct
                object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To
                prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

                Having deprived her of this first right of a citizen, the
                elective franchise. thereby leaving her without representation
                in the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.

            <p data-position="7">
                He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly
                dead. He has taken from her all right in property. even to the
                wages she earns.
            </p>

            <p data-position="8">
                He has made her, morally. an irresponsible being. as she can
                commit many crimes with impunity, provided they be done in the
                presence of her husband.

                In the covenant of marriage, she is compelled to promise
                obedience to her husband, he becoming, to all intents and

                of her liberty. and to administer chastisement.

                He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the
                proper causes, and in case of separation, to whom the
                guardianship of the children shall be given, as to be wholly
                regardless of the happiness of women — the law, in all cases,
                going upon a false supposition of the supremacy of man, and
                giving all power into his hands.

                After depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if single,
                and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support a
                government which recognizes her only when her property can be
                made profitable to it.

                He has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments, and
                from those she is permitted to follow, she receives but a scanty
                remuneration. He closes against her all the avenues to wealth
                and distinction which he considers most honorable to himself. As
                a teacher of theology, medicine, or law, she is not known.
            </p>

            <p data-position="13">

                He allows her in Church, as well as State, but a subordinate
                position, claiming Apostolic authority for her exclusion from

                participation in the affairs of the Church.

                He has created a false public sentiment by giving to the world a
                different code of morals for men and women, by which moral
                delinquencies which exclude women from society, are not only
                tolerated, but deemed of little account in man.

                feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived
                of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate

            <p data-position="20">
                WHEREAS, The great precept of nature is conceded to be, that '
                man shall pursue his own true and substantial happiness."
                Blackstone in his Commentaries remarks, that this law of Nature
                being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of
                course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over
                all the globe, in all countries and at all times; no human laws
                are of any validity if contrary to this. and such of them as are
                valid, derive all their force. and all their validity, and all
                their authority, mediately and immediately, from this original;
                therefore,
            </p>

            <p data-position="21">
                Resolved, That such laws as conflict, in any way with the true
                and substantial happiness of woman, are contrary to the great
                precept of nature and of no validity, for this is "superior in
                obligation to any other."
            </p>

            <p data-position="22">
                Resolved, That all laws which prevent woman from occupying such
                a station in society as her conscience shall dictate, or which
                place her in a position inferior to that of man, are contrary to
                the great precept of nature, and therefore of no force or
                authority.
            </p>

            <p data-position="23">
                Resolved, That woman is man's equal — was intended to be so by
                the Creator, and the highest good of the race demands that she
                should be recognized as such.
            </p>

            <p data-position="24">
                Resolved, That the women of this country ought to be enlightened
                in regard to the laws under which they live, that they may no
                longer publish their degradation by declaring themselves
                satisfied with their present position, nor their ignorance. by
                asserting that they have all the rights they want.
            </p>

            <p data-position="25">
                Resolved. That inasmuch as man, while claiming for himself
                intellectual superiority. does accord to woman moral superionty.
                it is pre-eminently his duty to encourage her to speak and
                teach. as she has an opportunity, in all religious assemblies.
            </p>

            <p data-position="26">
                Resolved, That the same amount of virtue, delicacy, and
                refinement of behavior that is required of woman in the social
                state, should also be required of man, and the same
                transgressions should be visited with equal severity on both man
                and woman.
            </p>

            <p data-position="27">
                Resolved, That the objection of indelicacy and impropriety,
                which is so often brought against woman when she addresses a
                public audience, comes with a very ill-grace from those who
                encourage, by their attendance, her appearance on the stage, in
                the concert. Or in feats of the circus.
            </p>

            <p data-position="28">
                Resolved, That woman has too long rested satisfied in the
                circumscribed limits which corrupt customs and a perverted
                application of the Scriptures have marked out for her, and that
                it is time she should move in the enlarged sphere which her
                great Creator has assigned her.
            </p>

            <p data-position="29">
                Resolved, That it is the duty of the women of this country to
                secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective
                franchise.
            </p>

            <p data-position="30">
                Resolved, That the equality of human rights results necessarily
                from the fact of the identity of the race in capabilities and
                responsibilities.
            </p>

            <p data-position="31">
                Resolved, therefore. That. being invested by the creator with
                the same capabilities. and the same consciousness of
                responsibility for their exercise, it is demonstrably the right
                and duty of woman, equally with man, to promote every righteous
                cause by every righteous means; and especially in regard to the
                great subjects of morals and religion, it is self-evidently her
                right to participate with her brother in teaching them, both in
                private and in public, by writing and by speaking. by any
                instrumentalities proper to be used. and in any assemblies
                proper to be held; and this being a self evident truth growing
                out of the divinely implanted principles of human nature, any
                custom or authority adverse to it. whether modern or wearing the
                hoary sanction of antiquity, is to be regarded as a self-
                evident falsehood, and at war with mankind.
